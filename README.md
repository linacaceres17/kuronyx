# Kuronyx

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.3.

The e-commerce consists of 3 views, the main one where the search engine and the general list of products go, the next one where the option to add the products to the cart is given and the last one where you will be redirected to the WhatsApp chat to continue with the purchase.
It is divided into the header, home and footer, there are four product categories, and a total of 22 products were handled. The client was satisfied with the result because the color palette she wanted was handled and the products she wanted were shown. 
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
